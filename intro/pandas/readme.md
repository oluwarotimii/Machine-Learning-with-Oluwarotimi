  # Pandas: Data Manipulation and Analysis
What is Pandas?
Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

It provides data structures like DataFrames and Series to handle tabular and time-series data.

It’s built on top of NumPy, so it’s fast and efficient.

Why Learn Pandas?
Data Cleaning: Easily handle missing data, duplicates, and outliers.

Data Exploration: Quickly summarize and visualize data.

Data Preparation: Prepare data for machine learning models.

Integration: Works seamlessly with other libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

Key Concepts in Pandas
1. Series
A one-dimensional array-like object that can hold any data type.

Similar to a column in a spreadsheet.

2. DataFrame
A two-dimensional table-like data structure with rows and columns.

Similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table.

3. Data Import/Export
Read and write data from/to CSV, Excel, SQL databases, etc.

4. Data Selection and Filtering
Select rows, columns, or specific elements from a DataFrame.

5. Handling Missing Data
