## Matplotlib: Data Visualization in Python
What is Matplotlib?
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

It provides a MATLAB-like interface for plotting graphs and charts.

It’s highly customizable and integrates well with Pandas and NumPy.

Why Learn Matplotlib?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize data distributions, trends, and relationships.

Model Evaluation: Plot learning curves, confusion matrices, etc.

Customization: Create publication-quality plots.

Integration: Works seamlessly with Pandas, NumPy, and other libraries.

Key Concepts in Matplotlib
1. Pyplot Interface
The pyplot module provides a simple interface for creating plots.

It’s similar to MATLAB’s plotting system.

2. Basic Plots
Line plots, bar plots, scatter plots, histograms, etc.

3. Customization
Titles, labels, legends, colors, markers, and styles.

4. Subplots
Create multiple plots in a single figure.

5. Advanced Plots
Box plots, heatmaps, pie charts,
