## Key Concepts in NumPy
1. NumPy Arrays
The core data structure in NumPy is the ndarray (n-dimensional array).

Arrays are homogeneous (all elements are of the same type).

2. Array Creation
You can create arrays from Python lists or using built-in functions like np.zeros, np.ones, np.arange, etc.

3. Array Operations
Element-wise operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.).

Broadcasting: Performing operations on arrays of different shapes.

4. Indexing and Slicing
Accessing and modifying elements in an array.

5. Mathematical Functions
NumPy provides functions like np.sum, np.mean, np.std, np.sin, np.exp, etc.

6. Reshaping and Stacking
Changing the shape of an array (reshape, flatten).

Combining arrays (np.concatenate, np.stack).
