## **Machine Learning Journey Repository**

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Journey Repository**! This repository documents my progress as I learn and explore the world of Machine Learning (ML). It includes **beginner-friendly projects** to build foundational skills and **intermediate-level projects** to tackle more complex problems. Each project is designed to help me understand key concepts, tools, and techniques in ML, while also building practical skills that I can apply to real-world problems.

## **About This Repository**
This repository is a collection of **Machine Learning projects** that Iâ€™ve built as part of my learning journey. The projects are divided into **beginner** and **intermediate** levels, covering a variety of domains such as **classification**, **regression**, **clustering**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Computer Vision**. Each project includes a detailed explanation of the problem, the approach, and the results.

## **Learning Roadmap**
Before diving into projects, Iâ€™ll learn the following frameworks and libraries step-by-step:
1. **NumPy**: For numerical computing.
2. **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
3. **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
4. **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms.
5. **TensorFlow/Keras**: For deep learning.
6. **NLTK/SpaCy**: For natural language processing.
7. **OpenCV**: For computer vision.

Each library will be explored in detail with examples and exercises before applying it to projects.
